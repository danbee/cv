My personal blog and photo site is a static site built using Hugo. It makes use
of SASS and ITCSS (Inverse Triangle CSS) to organise the styles.

#### [NeoMPC](http://pixelhum.com/neompc)

NeoMPC is a web based client for controlling an MPD server that was built using
PHP and jQuery and uses mpd.class.php to connect to the MPD server. I completed
all of the coding, interface design and graphics for this project.

My personal photography site is built using Ruby on Rails and jQuery, including
back-end admin pages.

#### Dan's CV

I built my CV/resume, a responsive design using Middleman, SASS and Markdown
that makes extensive use of HTML5, CSS3, typography and web fonts. The source
code is available on [Github](https://github.com/danbee/cv).
