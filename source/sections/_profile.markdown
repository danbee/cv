### Profile

**Experienced Software Developer with a Passion for Building Innovative Web
Solutions**

With over 20 years of expertise in software development, I specialize in
creating high-quality web applications using technologies like Ruby on Rails,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like React or VueJS), and
PostgreSQL. A lifelong programmer since my early days with the Sinclair ZX81, I
am driven to craft software that is both functional and delightful. My approach
to software development is rooted in the belief that the best products emerge
through well-tested code, collaborative teamwork, and an iterative process
guided by continuous feedback from stakeholders.
