### Profile

Dan started coding on his Sinclair ZX81 computer in 1985 and building things for the web in 1996. Now, also literate in design, he focuses mostly on building web applications from small simple websites and services to large enterprise-level systems. With a preference for simple and usable interfaces, Dan works best by prototyping ideas.

His attention to detail and the fact that he works "at his best" when alongside others makes him an ideal member for any team. Eager to learn new techniques and technologies, Dan loves working on interesting projects and strives for simple, elegant and maintainable code.

Since starting at thoughtbot London in 2012, Dan has become proficient in Scrum, and has been seeking professional development opportunities to achieve Scrum Master status.
