### Profile

I am a highly experienced software developer with 20+ years of experience
building software products for the web. I have been programming computers since
I got my Sinclair ZX81 in 1985 and have been making them do interesting and
delightful things since.

I mostly use Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like
React) and PostgreSQL. I believe the best software is well tested and built
collaboratively and iteratively with continual feedback from the product owner.
