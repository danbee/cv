### Profile

I am a passionate and highly experienced software developer with 20+ years of
experience building software products for the web. I have been programming
computers since I got my [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81)
in 1985 and have been making them do interesting and delightful things since.

I mostly use Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like
React) and PostgreSQL. I believe the best software is well tested and built
collaboratively and iteratively with continual feedback from the product owner.
