### Experience

#### <del>[New Bamboo](http://www.new-bamboo.co.uk)</del> [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com)

Nov 2012 &mdash; Present

As a developer at thoughtbot I work directly with the client to ensure that they get what they need. This involves working within a pragmatic and well defined Scrum framework, running User Story Workshops and helping clients to understand our process. I work with the team to plan sprints every week and run demos of the work that has been done.

We work mostly with Ruby on Rails and write high quality, well tested code.
